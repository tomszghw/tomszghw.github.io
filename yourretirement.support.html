<h2 style:"float:left">Your Retirement</h2>
<br>
<p>This comprehensive retirement planner uses input about your current financial assets, your current and future income, investments, and expenses, and predicts the state of your finances before and after retirement. It takes many factors into consideration based on your input: salary, raises, additional income, stock return rate, interest rates, cash ratio, your expenses, and tax rates. It accounts for future lump sum changes (large one-time expenses, inheritance, etc.). The parameters you enter can be saved for future calculations.</p> 

<p>The calculation uses Monte Carlo iterations, optionally using random variations in stock returns to simulate market fluctuations, in order to produce a range of possible outcomes and failure rates.</p>
